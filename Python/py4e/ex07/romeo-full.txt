From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library
It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to make them their own.
Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason, new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.
The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.
I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

Textual Introduction
By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine
Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the MobyTM Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate text.
Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural preference and taste. When the MobyTM Text was created, for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee...”). All Shakespeare editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her father, Prospero.
The editors of the MobyTM Shakespeare produced their text long before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the MobyTM, which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square brackets(forexample,fromHenryV:“With blood andswordand fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Hamlet:“Ofarewell,honest soldier. Whohathrelieved/you?”).At any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information.
Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

Synopsis
The prologue of Romeo and Juliet calls the title characters “star- crossed lovers”—and the stars do seem to conspire against these young lovers.
Romeo is a Montague, and Juliet a Capulet. Their families are enmeshed in a feud, but the moment they meet—when Romeo and his friends attend a party at Juliet’s house in disguise—the two fall in love and quickly decide that they want to be married.
A friar secretly marries them, hoping to end the feud. Romeo and his companions almost immediately encounter Juliet’s cousin Tybalt, who challenges Romeo. When Romeo refuses to fight, Romeo’s friend Mercutio accepts the challenge and is killed. Romeo then kills Tybalt and is banished. He spends that night with Juliet and then leaves for Mantua.
Juliet’s father forces her into a marriage with Count Paris. To avoid this marriage, Juliet takes a potion, given her by the friar, that makes her appear dead. The friar will send Romeo word to be at her family tomb when she awakes. The plan goes awry, and Romeo learns instead that she is dead. In the tomb, Romeo kills himself. Juliet wakes, sees his body, and commits suicide. Their deaths appear finally to end the feud.

THE PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus.
Two households, both alike in dignity
(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 5 A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love
And the continuance of their parents’ rage, 10 Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

Gregory, on my word we’ll not carry coals. No, for then we should be colliers.
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of

But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I
will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s. GREGORY That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest
goes to the wall. 15 SAMPSON ’Tis true, and therefore women, being the
weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall and
thrust his maids to the wall.
GREGORY The quarrel is between our masters and us 20 their men.
SAMPSON ’Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.

What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.

I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me. 70

As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.

Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbor-stainèd steel—
Will they not hear?—What ho! You men, you beasts, 85 That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins:
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your movèd prince. 90 Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
And made Verona’s ancient citizens
Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments 95 To wield old partisans in hands as old,
Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away. 100 You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
And, Montague, come you this afternoon
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. 105

MONTAGUE,   to Benvolio
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BENVOLIO
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
LADY MONTAGUE
O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BENVOLIO
Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind   drove   me to walk abroad, Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ’ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own
(Which then most sought where most might not be
found,
Being one too many by my weary self), Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
MONTAGUE
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.

But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night.
Black and portentous must this humor prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove. BENVOLIO
My noble uncle, do you know the cause? MONTAGUE
I neither know it nor can learn of him. BENVOLIO
Have you importuned him by any means? MONTAGUE
Both by myself and many other friends. But he,   his   own affections’ counselor, Is to himself—I will not say how true, But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know.
Enter Romeo.
BENVOLIO
See where he comes. So please you, step aside. I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.

I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift.—Come, madam, let’s away.

Not having that which, having, makes them short.

Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine?—O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love. 180 Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
O anything of nothing first   create!
O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
Misshapen chaos of   well-seeming   forms,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, 185 Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!

Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown 195 Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet, 200 A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here. 205 This is not Romeo. He’s some other where.

Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who. ROMEO

In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

A right good markman! And she’s fair I love.

From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms, 220 Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor
That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
BENVOLIO
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? 225
ROMEO
She hath, and in that sparing   makes   huge waste;
For beauty, starved with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
BENVOLIO
Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
ROMEO
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
BENVOLIO
By giving liberty unto thine eyes. Examine other beauties.
ROMEO ’Tis the way
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair. He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair;
What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who passed that passing fair? Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

Enter Capulet, County Paris, and   a Servingman.

But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike, and ’tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARIS
Of honorable reckoning are you both,
And pity ’tis you lived at odds so long. 5 But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET
But saying o’er what I have said before.
My child is yet a stranger in the world.
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
Let two more summers wither in their pride 10 Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PARIS
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAPULET
And too soon marred are those so early made.
Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
She’s the hopeful lady of my earth. 15 But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
My will to her consent is but a part.
And, she agreed, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustomed feast, 20 Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love; and you among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light. 25 Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-appareled April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight

Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, 30 And like her most whose merit most shall be;
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
May stand in number, though in reck’ning none.
Come go with me. To Servingman, giving him a list.
Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona, find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
Capulet and Paris   exit.

SERVINGMAN Find them out whose names are written
here! It is written that the shoemaker should
meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
But I am sent to find those persons whose names
are here writ, and can never find what names the
writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. 45 In good time!
Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
BENVOLIO,   to Romeo
Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning;
One pain is lessened by another’s anguish.
Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish. 50 Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROMEO
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLIO
For what, I pray thee?
ROMEO For your broken shin. 55 BENVOLIO Why Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,

Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. SERVINGMAN Perhaps you have learned it without

Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves, 90 With all the admirèd beauties of Verona.
Go thither, and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. ROMEO
When the devout religion of mine eye 95 Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
And these who, often drowned, could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun. 100 BENVOLIO
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye;
But in that crystal scales let there be weighed
Your lady’s love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast, 105 And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
ROMEO
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

How now, who calls? 5 Your mother.
Madam, I am here. What is your will? LADY CAPULET
This is the matter.—Nurse, give leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.—Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me, thou ’s hear our counsel. 10 Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
NURSE
Faith, I can tell her age unto   an hour.
LADY CAPULET She’s not fourteen.
NURSE I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen
be it spoken, I have but four) she’s not fourteen. 15
How long is it now to Lammastide? LADY CAPULET A fortnight and odd days. NURSE
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!) 20 Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me. But, as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.
’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, 25 And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)
Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
My lord and you were then at Mantua. 30 Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with   the   dug.
“Shake,” quoth the dovehouse. ’Twas no need, I 35

To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years.
For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th’
rood,
She could have run and waddled all about,
For even the day before, she broke her brow,
And then my husband (God be with his soul,
He was a merry man) took up the child.
“Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit, Wilt thou not, Jule?” And, by my holidam,
The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”
To see now how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it. “Wilt thou not, Jule?”
quoth he.
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”
LADY CAPULET
Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.
NURSE
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cock’rel’s stone,
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
“Yea,” quoth my husband. “Fall’st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age, Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “Ay.”
JULIET
And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
NURSE
Peace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace, Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nursed. An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

Marry, that “marry” is the very theme

JULIET
It is an   honor   that I dream not of. NURSE
An   honor?   Were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy
teat. LADY CAPULET
Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers. By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. NURSE
A man, young lady—lady, such a man
As all the world—why, he’s a man of wax. LADY CAPULET
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower. NURSE
Nay, he’s a flower, in faith, a very flower. LADY CAPULET
What say you? Can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast. Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face, And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen. Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content,
And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him only lacks a cover.
The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride

You are a lover. Borrow Cupid’s wings
And soar with them above a common bound.

I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound 20 I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.

And to sink in it should you burden love— Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROMEO
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, 25 Too rude, too boist’rous, and it pricks like thorn.

If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.—

ACT 1. SC. 4
She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate stone 60 On the forefinger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little   atomi
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.
Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, 65 Her traces of the smallest spider web,
Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,
Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm 70 Pricked from the lazy finger of a   maid.
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night 75 Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
On courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues 80 Because their   breaths   with sweetmeats tainted are.
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep; 85 Then he dreams of another benefice.
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon 90 Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night

Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, 105 Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
Even now the frozen bosom of the north

Romeo and Juliet
ACT 1. SC. 5
You are welcome, gentlemen.—Come, musicians,
play. Music plays and they dance. 30
A hall, a hall, give room!—And foot it, girls.—
More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.—
Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.—
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet, 35 For you and I are past our dancing days.
How long is ’t now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
CAPULET’S COUSIN By ’r Lady, thirty years. CAPULET
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much. 40 ’Tis since the nuptial of   Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.
CAPULET’S COUSIN
’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir.
His son is thirty. 45
CAPULET Will you tell me that? His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROMEO,   to a Servingman
What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight?
SERVINGMAN I know not, sir. 50 ROMEO
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear—
Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows 55 As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand
And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night. 60

This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—
Fetch me my rapier, boy. Page exits.
What, dares the slave Come hither covered with an antic face
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? 65 Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET
Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite 70 To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAPULET
Young Romeo is it?
TYBALT ’Tis he, that villain Romeo. CAPULET
Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, 75 And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
I would not for the wealth of all this town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient. Take no note of him. 80 It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYBALT
It fits when such a villain is a guest.
I’ll not endure him. 85
CAPULET He shall be endured. What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to.
Am I the master here or you? Go to.

Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
CAPULET Go to, go to.
You are a saucy boy. Is ’t so indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what. 95 You must contrary me. Marry, ’tis time—
Well said, my hearts.—You are a princox, go.
Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—for shame,
I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts!
TYBALT
Patience perforce with willful choler meeting 100 Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall.
He exits.
ROMEO,   taking Juliet’s hand
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: 105 My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch, 110 And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.
ROMEO
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO
O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.
They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. 115
JULIET
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.

Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! 120

Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Juliet moves toward her mother.
ROMEO
What is her mother?
NURSE Marry, bachelor, 125 Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks. Nurse moves away. 130 ROMEO,   aside Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt. BENVOLIO
Away, begone. The sport is at the best. ROMEO
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest. CAPULET
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone. 135 We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.—
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all.
I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.—

Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

That I must love a loathèd enemy. 155

Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir.
That fair for which love groaned for and would die,
With tender Juliet   matched,   is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, 5 Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear, 10 And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new belovèd anywhere.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Temp’ring extremities with extreme sweet.
    Chorus exits.

Romeo, my cousin Romeo, Romeo!
MERCUTIO He is wise
And, on my life, hath stol’n him home to bed.
BENVOLIO
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall. Call, good Mercutio.
MERCUTIO Nay, I’ll conjure too. Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied.
Cry but “Ay me,”   pronounce   but “love” and
“dove.”
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nickname for her purblind son and   heir, Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so   trim When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.— He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not. The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.—
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
BENVOLIO
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MERCUTIO
This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down. That were some spite. My invocation
Is fair and honest. In his mistress’ name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.

Come, he hath hid himself among these trees

To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love and best befits the dark. 35 MERCUTIO
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.—
O Romeo, that she were, O, that she were 40 An   open-arse,   thou a pop’rin pear.
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.— Come, shall we go?

 But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief 5 That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid since she is envious.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
It is my lady. O, it is my love! 10 O, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.

I am too bold. ’Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, 15 Having some business,   do   entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those
stars 20 As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O, that I were a glove upon that hand, 25 That I might touch that cheek!
JULIET Ay me.
ROMEO,   aside She speaks.
O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head, 30 As is a wingèd messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturnèd wond’ring eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air. 35
JULIET
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO, aside
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 40
JULIET
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name
Belonging to a man. 45 What’s in a name? That which we call a rose

So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, 50 And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
ROMEO I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized.
Henceforth I never will be Romeo. 55
JULIET
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself 60 Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? 65
ROMEO
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
JULIET
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here. 70
ROMEO
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

ROMEO
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes, And, but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate
Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.
JULIET
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
ROMEO
By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore   washed   with the farthest sea, I should adventure for such merchandise.
JULIET
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment. Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say “Ay,” And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st, Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries, They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my   havior
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true

Than those that have   more   coying to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard’st ere I was ware
My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love, 110
Which the dark night hath so discoverèd. ROMEO
Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops— JULIET
O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her   circled   orb, 115 Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

JULIET Do not swear at all.
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry, 120 And I’ll believe thee.

Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden, 125 Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.

May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.

My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 140 My love as deep. The more I give to thee,

So thrive my soul—
A thousand times good night.

A thousand times the worse to want thy light. 165 Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their

But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Going.
Enter Juliet   above   again.
JULIET
Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc’ner’s voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than   mine With repetition of “My Romeo!”
ROMEO
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears.
JULIET Romeo.

I will not fail. ’Tis twenty year till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back.

JULIET
’Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone, 190 And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
That lets it hop a little from his hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silken thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty. 195
ROMEO
I would I were thy bird.
JULIET Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet
sorrow 200 That I shall say “Good night” till it be morrow.
She exits.
ROMEO
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.
Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. 205

ACT 2. SC. 3
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers. The Earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb; What is her burying grave, that is her womb;
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities. For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live
But to the Earth some special good doth give; Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use, Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
And vice sometime by action dignified.
Enter Romeo.
Within the infant rind of this weak flower Poison hath residence and medicine power: For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each
part;
Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart. Two such opposèd kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
ROMEO
Good morrow, father.
FRIAR LAWRENCE Benedicite.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distempered head
So soon to bid “Good morrow” to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie; But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain

Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uproused with some distemp’rature, Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
ROMEO
That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
ROMEO
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
I have forgot that name and that name’s woe.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been
then? ROMEO
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage. When and where and how
We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us today.

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears. Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
If e’er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline. And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence
then:
Women may fall when there’s no strength in men.
ROMEO
Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROMEO
And bad’st me bury love.
FRIAR LAWRENCE Not in a grave To lay one in, another out to have.
ROMEO
I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so.
FRIAR LAWRENCE O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. But come, young waverer, come, go with me. In one respect I’ll thy assistant be,
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households’ rancor to pure love.

Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.

A challenge, on my life.
Romeo will answer it. 10
Any man that can write may answer a letter. Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how
he dares, being dared.
MERCUTIO Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,
stabbed with a white wench’s black eye, run 15 through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his
heart cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt shaft. And
is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
BENVOLIO Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTIO More than prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous 20
captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.

passado, the punto reverso, the hay!
BENVOLIO The what?
MERCUTIO The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
phantasimes,   these new tuners of accent: “By 30 Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good
whore!” Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,
that we should be thus afflicted with these

slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
ROMEO Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive? 50 ROMEO Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was
great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain
courtesy.

yours constrains a man to bow in the hams. 55 ROMEO Meaning, to curtsy.

of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, 65

singleness.

MERCUTIO Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I
70
am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in
one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole 75 five. Was I with you there for the goose?
ROMEO Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.
MERCUTIO I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

sharp sauce.

goose?

from an inch narrow to an ell broad.

added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a

bid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will
keep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you
should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they say, it
were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For 170 the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you
should deal double with her, truly it were an ill
thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very
weak dealing.

mark me. 180

ACT 2. SC. 5
Driving back shadows over louring hills.
Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve 10 Is   three   long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me. 15 But old folks, many feign as they were dead,
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Enter Nurse   and Peter.
O God, she comes!—O, honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
NURSE Peter, stay at the gate. Peter exits. 20 JULIET
Now, good sweet nurse—O Lord, why lookest thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face. 25
NURSE
I am aweary. Give me leave awhile.
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!
JULIET
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,
speak. 30 NURSE
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?

Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that. Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance. Let me be satisfied; is ’t good or bad?
NURSE Well, you have made a simple choice. You know 40 not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.
Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg
excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a
body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they
are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, 45 but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at
home?
JULIET
No, no. But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? What of that? 50
NURSE
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o’ t’ other side! Ah, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jaunting up and down. 55
JULIET
I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my
love?
NURSE Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I 60
warrant, a virtuous—Where is your mother? JULIET
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:
“Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?” 65

Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell.
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks; 75 They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church. I must another way,
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go. I’ll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.

So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
ROMEO
Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight. Do thou but close our hands with holy words, Then love-devouring death do what he dare, It is enough I may but call her mine.

The day is hot, the Capels   are   abroad,
And if we meet we shall not ’scape a brawl,
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when 5 he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his
sword upon the table and says “God send me no
need of thee” and, by the operation of the second
cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is
no need. 10 BENVOLIO Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTIO Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy
mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be
moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
BENVOLIO And what to? 15 MERCUTIO Nay, an there were two such, we should
have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
Thou—why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that
hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than
thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking 20 nuts, having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as

an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been
beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast 25 quarreled with a man for coughing in the street
because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain
asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor
for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With
another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon? 30 And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?
BENVOLIO An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

The fee simple? O simple! 35
Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.
By my head, here comes the Capulets. By my heel, I care not.

MERCUTIO
TYBALT,   to his companions
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.—
Gentlemen, good e’en. A word with one of you.
MERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it 40
with something. Make it a word and a blow. TYBALT You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an
you will give me occasion.
MERCUTIO Could you not take some occasion without
giving?
TYBALT Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. MERCUTIO Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?
45
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear
nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick; here’s
that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort! 50

Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.

But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower.

TYBALT
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain.
ROMEO
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none. 65 Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
TYBALT
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.
ROMEO
I do protest I never injured thee
But love thee better than thou canst devise Till thou shalt know the reason of my love. And so, good Capulet, which name I tender As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

O calm, dishonorable, vile submission! Alla stoccato carries it away.

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? BENVOLIO
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay— 160 Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure. All this utterèd
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 165 Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends 170 It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud
“Hold, friends! Friends, part!” and swifter than his
tongue
His   agile   arm beats down their fatal points, 175 And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertained revenge, 180 And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
LADY CAPULET
He is a kinsman to the Montague. 185 Affection makes him false; he speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.

Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold, 15 Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in
night,
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back. 20 Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browed
night,
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 25 That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love
But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day 30 As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them.
Enter Nurse with cords.
O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks 35
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.— Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The
cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
NURSE Ay, ay, the cords. 40

Ah weraday, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead! We are undone, lady, we are undone.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead.
JULIET
Can heaven be so envious?
NURSE Romeo can, Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo, Whoever would have thought it? Romeo!
JULIET
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus? This torture should be roared in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but “Ay,” And that bare vowel “I” shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I if there be such an “I,”
Or those eyes   shut   that makes thee answer “Ay.” If he be slain, say “Ay,” or if not, “No.”
Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.
NURSE
I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes
(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast— A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,
All in gore blood. I swoonèd at the sight.
JULIET
O break, my heart, poor bankrout, break at once! To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.

O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman, That ever I should live to see thee dead!

Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom, For who is living if those two are gone?
NURSE
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banishèd. Romeo that killed him—he is banishèd.
JULIET
O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
NURSE
It did, it did, alas the day, it did.
JULIET
O serpent heart hid with a flow’ring face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical! Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb! Despisèd substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
A   damnèd   saint, an honorable villain.
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!
NURSE There’s no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae. These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me
old.
Shame come to Romeo!

For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned

ACT 3. SC. 2
Sole monarch of the universal Earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him! NURSE
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin? 105 JULIET
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy
name
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? 110 That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain, 115 And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my
husband.
All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
That murdered me. I would forget it fain, 120 But, O, it presses to my memory
Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners’ minds:
“Tybalt is dead and Romeo banishèd.”
That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd,”
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death 125 Was woe enough if it had ended there;
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be ranked with other griefs,
Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,”
“Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both, 130 Which modern lamentation might have moved?
But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death,
“Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. “Romeo is banishèd.” 135 There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,

Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. 140 JULIET
Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.— Take up those cords.
The Nurse picks up the rope ladder.
Poor ropes, you are beguiled, 145 Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.
He made you for a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowèd.
Come, cords—come, nurse. I’ll to my wedding bed,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! 150

Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
To comfort you. I wot well where he is. Hark you, your Romeo will be here at night. I’ll to him. He is hid at Lawrence’ cell.

Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom? What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand That I yet know not?
FRIAR LAWRENCE Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company. I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
ROMEO
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
FRIAR LAWRENCE
A gentler judgment vanished from his lips: Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
ROMEO
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say “death,”
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death. Do not say “banishment.”
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Here from Verona art thou banishèd.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROMEO
There is no world without Verona walls
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence “banishèd” is “banished from the world,” And world’s exile is death. Then “banishèd”
Is death mistermed. Calling death “banishèd,” Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince, Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law
And turned that black word “death” to
“banishment.”
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

ACT 3. SC. 3
ROMEO
’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
But Romeo may not. More validity,
More honorable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips, Who even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; But Romeo may not; he is banishèd.
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly. They are free men, but I am banishèd.
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death? Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground
knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean, But “banishèd” to kill me? “Banishèd”?
O friar, the damnèd use that word in hell. Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin absolver, and my friend professed,
To mangle me with that word “banishèd”?
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thou   fond mad man, hear me a little speak. ROMEO
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. FRIAR LAWRENCE
I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word, Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banishèd.

With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says 105 My concealed lady to our canceled love?

And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And “Tybalt” calls, and then on Romeo cries,

Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts   denote 120 The unreasonable fury of a beast.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,

And slay thy lady that in thy life   lives,
By doing damnèd hate upon thyself?
Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet 130 In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?

Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all
And usest none in that true use indeed

Digressing from the valor of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;

Afore me, it is so very late that we
May call it early by and by.—Good night.
They exit.

JULIET
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.

ACT 3. SC. 5
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. 5 ROMEO
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops. 10 I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULIET
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun   exhaled
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua. 15 Therefore stay yet. Thou need’st not to be gone.
ROMEO
Let me be ta’en; let me be put to death.
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon gray is not the morning’s eye;
’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow. 20 Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
How is ’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day. 25
JULIET
It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. Some say the lark makes sweet division.
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
Some say the lark and loathèd toad changed O, now I would they had changed voices too, Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day. O, now begone. More light and light it grows.

Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
The day is broke; be wary; look about. JULIET
Then, window, let day in, and let life out. ROMEO
Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I’ll descend.
They kiss, and Romeo descends.
JULIET
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend! I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo.
ROMEO Farewell.
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET
O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our times to come.
JULIET
O God, I have an ill-divining soul! Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.

For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.
Enter   Lady Capulet.
LADY CAPULET Ho, daughter, are you up? 65 JULIET
Who is ’t that calls? It is my lady mother.
Is she not down so late or up so early?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
Juliet descends.
LADY CAPULET
Why, how now, Juliet?
JULIET Madam, I am not well. 70 LADY CAPULET
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of
love, 75 But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
JULIET
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
LADY CAPULET
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.
JULIET Feeling so the loss, 80 I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
LADY CAPULET
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.

LADY CAPULET That same villain, Romeo. JULIET, aside
Villain and he be many miles asunder.— God pardon   him.   I do with all my heart, And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
LADY CAPULET
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
JULIET
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!
LADY CAPULET
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
JULIET
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed. Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors To hear him named and cannot come to him To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.
LADY CAPULET
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man. But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
JULIET
And joy comes well in such a needy time. What are they, beseech your Ladyship?

One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.
JULIET
Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
LADY CAPULET
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
JULIET
Now, by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
LADY CAPULET
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.
Enter Capulet and Nurse.
CAPULET
When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew, But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright.
How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears? Evermore show’ring? In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs, Who, raging with thy tears and they with them, Without a sudden calm, will overset

Thy tempest-tossèd body.—How now, wife?

Ay, sir, but she will none, she   gives   you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave. 145 CAPULET
Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bride? 150
JULIET
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate,
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
CAPULET
How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?
“Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,” 155 And yet “not proud”? Mistress minion you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. 160 Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
You tallow face!
LADY CAPULET Fie, fie, what, are you mad? JULIET, kneeling
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word. 165 CAPULET
Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch! I tell thee what: get thee to church o’ Thursday, Or never after look me in the face.

To answer “I’ll not wed. I cannot love.
I am too young. I pray you, pardon me.”
But, an you will not wed, I’ll pardon you!
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me. 200 Look to ’t; think on ’t. I do not use to jest.

FRIAR LAWRENCE
You say you do not know the lady’s mind?
Uneven is the course. I like it not. 5
PARIS
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
And therefore have I little talk of love,
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway, 10 And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste. 15

I will confess to you that I love him. PARIS
So will you, I am sure, that you love me. JULIET
If I do so, it will be of more price
Being spoke behind your back than to your face. PARIS
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. JULIET

For it was bad enough before their spite. PARIS
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report. JULIET
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
And what I spake, I spake it to my face. PARIS
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it. JULIET

O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,

On Thursday next be married to this County. 50

Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I’ll help it presently. 55
She shows him her knife.
God joined my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s sealed, Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both. 60 Therefore out of thy long-experienced time
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art 65 Could to no issue of true honor bring.
Be not so long to speak. I long to die
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.

Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution 70 As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to   slay   thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame, 75 That cop’st with death himself to ’scape from it;
And if thou darest, I’ll give thee remedy.

O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of any tower,
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk 80 Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,
Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,
O’ercovered quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow   chapless   skulls.
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his   shroud
(Things that to hear them told have made me

And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstained wife to my sweet love. 90
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold, then. Go home; be merry; give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow. Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
Holding out a vial.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed, 95 And this distilling liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
No warmth, no   breath   shall testify thou livest. 100

Romeo and Juliet
ACT 4. SC. 1
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To   paly   ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death, 105 And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. 110 Then, as the manner of our country is,
In   thy best robes uncovered on the bier
Thou   shalt   be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, 115 Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come, and he and I
Will watch thy   waking,   and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame, 120 If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valor in the acting it.
JULIET
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
FRIAR LAWRENCE,   giving Juliet the vial
Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous
In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed 125 To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.
JULIET
Love give me strength, and strength shall help
afford.
Farewell, dear father.

One or two of the Servingmen exit with Capulet’s list.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. SERVINGMAN You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if
they can lick their fingers.
CAPULET How canst thou try them so? 5 SERVINGMAN Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick
his own fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
CAPULET Go, begone.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.— 10 What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
NURSE Ay, forsooth. CAPULET
Well, he may chance to do some good on her. A peevish   self-willed   harlotry it is.
Enter Juliet.
NURSE
See where she comes from shrift with merry look. 15
CAPULET
How now, my headstrong, where have you been
gadding? JULIET
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here
To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you. Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell And gave him what becomèd love I might, Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
CAPULET
Why, I am glad on ’t. This is well. Stand up.
Juliet rises.
This is as ’t should be.—Let me see the County. Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.— Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.
JULIET
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?

No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.

Go, nurse. Go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.

I’ll not to bed tonight. Let me alone.

To County Paris, to prepare up him
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.

To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
Enter   Lady Capulet.
LADY CAPULET
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
JULIET
No, madam, we have culled such necessaries As are behooveful for our state tomorrow. So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the Nurse this night sit up with you, For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.
LADY CAPULET Good night. Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
Lady Capulet and the Nurse   exit.
JULIET
Farewell.—God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life.

Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man. 30 How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point.
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, 35 And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place—
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle 40 Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed;
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies fest’ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort— 45 Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad—
O, if I   wake,   shall I not be distraught, 50 Environèd with all these hideous fears,
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints,
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
As with a club, dash out my desp’rate brains? 55 O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapier’s point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink. I drink to
thee. She drinks and falls upon her bed 60 within the curtains.

But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!

Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed! Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! My soul and not my child! Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,
And with my child my joys are burièd.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion’s   cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all, And all the better is it for the maid.
Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion,
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced; And weep you now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love you love your child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
She’s not well married that lives married long, But she’s best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
And in her best array, bear her to church,
For though   fond   nature bids us all lament, Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom’s   lord   sits lightly in his throne,
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. 5 I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to
think!)
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
That I revived and was an emperor. 10 Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed
When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!
Enter Romeo’s man   Balthasar, in riding boots.
News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well? 15 How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
BALTHASAR
Then she is well and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument,

Romeo and Juliet
ACT 5. SC. 1
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you.
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
ROMEO
Is it e’en so?—Then I deny you, stars!— 25 Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
BALTHASAR
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure. 30
ROMEO Tush, thou art deceived. Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
BALTHASAR
No, my good lord.
ROMEO No matter. Get thee gone, 35 And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.
Balthasar exits.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
I do remember an apothecary 40 (And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted
In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, 45 An alligator stuffed, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses 50 Were thinly scattered to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said

ACT 5. SC. 1
“An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.” 55 O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.—
What ho, Apothecary! 60
Enter Apothecary.
APOTHECARY Who calls so loud? ROMEO
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
He offers money.
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins, 65 That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
APOTHECARY
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law 70 Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back. 75 The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law.
The world affords no law to make thee rich.
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
APOTHECARY
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

APOTHECARY,   giving him the poison
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off, and if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
ROMEO,   handing him the money
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
Doing more murder in this loathsome world 85 Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not
sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Apothecary exits.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

This same should be the voice of Friar John.— Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR JOHN
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth, So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.

Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection. FRIAR LAWRENCE
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge, Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence. Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell.
FRIAR JOHN
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake. She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents.
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!

Enter Paris and his Page.
PARIS
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof. Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.

Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
(O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans. 15 The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee, 25 Whate’er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 30 A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.
But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I farther shall intend to do,

He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?

Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, 95 And death’s pale flag is not advancèd there.—
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favor can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy? 100 Forgive me, cousin.—Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour? 105 For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this   palace   of dim night
Depart again. Here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest 110 And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death. 115
Kissing Juliet.
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide! Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!

O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave? PRINCE
Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile, Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring, their head, their true
descent,
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.— Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemnèd and myself excused.
PRINCE
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
FRIAR LAWRENCE
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead,   that   Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them, and their stol’n marriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city, For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betrothed and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean

Romeo and Juliet
ACT 5. SC. 3
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stayed by accident, and yesternight Returned my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixèd hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awakening, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes, and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, And she, too desperate, would not go with me But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know, and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed some hour before his time
Unto the rigor of severest law.
PRINCE
We still have known thee for a holy man.— Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
BALTHASAR
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death, And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.

Romeo and Juliet
ACT 5. SC. 3
This letter he early bid me give his father
And threatened me with death, going in the vault, 285 If I departed not and left him there.
PRINCE
Give me the letter. I will look on it.—
He takes Romeo’s letter.
Where is the County’s page, that raised the watch?—
Sirrah, what made your master in this place? 290 PAGE
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch. 295 PRINCE
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death; And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet. 300 Where be these enemies?—Capulet, Montague,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. 305 CAPULET
O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand.
MONTAGUE But I can give thee more,
For I will ray her statue in pure gold, 310 That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
PRINCE
A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some punishèd. For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
